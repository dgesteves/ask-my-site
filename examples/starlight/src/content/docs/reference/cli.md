The `ask-my-site` command has four subcommands: `index` builds or checks the index, `init` writes the endpoint for your host, `dev` serves the endpoint on your machine, and `eval` scores retrieval against questions whose answers you know. Run them with `npx ask-my-site`, or from a `package.json` script.

## ask-my-site index

`ask-my-site index [dir] [options]` builds `ask-index.json` from the Markdown, MDX and HTML files in `dir`.

## Choosing the embedding model

Without `--embedding`, the CLI uses `openai:text-embedding-3-small` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, or `openai/text-embedding-3-small` through AI Gateway when only `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is. With neither, it fails rather than quietly building a keyword-only index, and suggests `-e mock` to try it without a key. `-e none` builds a keyword-only index on purpose. `-e workers-ai:@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5` embeds with Workers AI over Cloudflare's REST API, with `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, for the [Workers AI Worker](/guides/workers-ai/); its vector size is fixed, so `--dimensions` does not apply.

## Environment and exit codes

The CLI reads `.env` and `.env.local` from the working directory, without overriding variables that are already set. It exits with 0 on success, 1 when the build fails or `--check` finds the index stale, and 2 on a usage error.

## ask-my-site init

`ask-my-site init [options]` writes the ask endpoint and the MCP endpoint for the site in the working directory and the host it deploys to: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare (Pages, or a Worker with static assets) or GitHub Pages, whose endpoint is a Cloudflare Worker of its own. It detects the site from its config (Docusaurus, Starlight, Astro, Next.js, VitePress, Hugo, MkDocs, Jekyll or Eleventy) and the host from `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, a wrangler config or a GitHub Pages workflow, and asks for the host when it cannot tell. [Deploying](/guides/deployment/#write-the-endpoint-with-init) shows what it writes for each.

| Flag                | Default                | What it does                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--host <name>`     | detected, else asked   | `vercel`, `netlify`, `cloudflare` or `github-pages`.                           |
| `--provider <name>` | `workers-ai`           | For `github-pages`: `workers-ai`, with no API key, or `openai`.                |
| `--site-url <url>`  | from the site's config | The site's public URL with its base path, which the GitHub Pages Worker reads. |
| `--name <text>`     | the site's title       | The site's name, in the model's instructions.                                  |
| `--out <dir>`       | detected               | A static site's build folder, where the index goes.                            |
| `--no-mcp`          | the MCP endpoint is on | Write the ask endpoint only.                                                   |
| `--dry-run`         | off                    | Print every file it would write, and write nothing.                            |
| `-y, --yes`         | asks                   | Overwrite files that differ without asking.                                    |
| `-h, --help`        |                        | Print the help.                                                                |

It prints each file it created, updated or left unchanged, the environment variables to set and where, and the steps left: the packages to install, the dialog to add and the deploy. It exits with 0 when everything is written, 1 when it left a file as it was or an edit for you to make by hand, and 2 on a usage error. It reads no `.env` file and no credential, and it deploys nothing. An Astro site with an SSR adapter gets no file: its integration serves the endpoints.

## ask-my-site dev

`ask-my-site dev [options]` serves `POST /api/ask` on 127.0.0.1, answering from a built index, for the dialog on your site's dev server. It serves the same index as an [MCP server](/integrations/mcp/) at `/api/mcp`, keyword-only, for your editor's agent.

| Flag                      | Default                                                              | What it does                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--index <file>`          | `ask-index.json`, `build/ask-index.json`, then `dist/ask-index.json` | The index to serve.                                     |
| `--port <n>`              | `8787`                                                               | Port to listen on.                                      |
| `--allow-origin <origin>` | localhost                                                            | Another origin allowed to call it, or `*`. Repeatable.  |
| `--model <id>`            | `gpt-5.4-mini`                                                       | OpenAI model for answers, when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. |
| `-h, --help`              |                                                                      | Print the help.                                         |

It embeds questions with the model the index records, answers with OpenAI when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and with the mock model otherwise, and reloads the index when the file changes. It only answers pages on this machine (localhost, 127.0.0.1 and [::1] origins, on any port) and requests addressed to localhost, so a site you visit cannot spend your key through it, and it caps request bodies at 64 KiB. [Try it locally](/get-started/local-development/) shows it with each integration.

## ask-my-site eval

`ask-my-site eval <questions.yaml> [options]` scores retrieval against a file of questions with the pages that answer them, and questions marked `unanswerable`: hit@1, hit@3, refusal precision and refusal recall, question by question. It exits 1 when a score is under its threshold. [Measure and improve answers](/guides/quality/#score-retrieval-with-eval) has the file's format.

| Flag                                                                                  | Default                                                                      | What it does                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--index <file>`                                                                      | the file's `index`, then `ask-index.json`, `build/`, `dist/`, `dist/client/` | The index to score.                         |
| `--min-hit-at-1`, `--min-hit-at-3`, `--min-refusal-precision`, `--min-refusal-recall` | the file's `thresholds`                                                      | Thresholds from 0 to 1.                     |
| `--keyword-only`                                                                      | off                                                                          | Search by keywords only, embedding nothing. |
| `--json`                                                                              | off                                                                          | Print the report as JSON.                   |
| `-h, --help`                                                                          |                                                                              | Print the help.                             |

It embeds each question with the model the index records, as `ask-my-site dev` does, and calls no language model. It loads `.env` and `.env.local` like `index`, and exits 2 on a usage error or a file it cannot read.

## The config file

For an embedding provider the specs don't cover, or content that is not on disk, pass a config module with `--config`. Every field is optional:

```js
// ask-my-site.config.mjs
import { cohere } from '@ai-sdk/cohere';
import { getPosts } from './lib/cms.mjs';

/** @type {import('ask-my-site/node').AskConfig} */
export default {
  embeddingModel: cohere.embedding('embed-multilingual-v3.0'),
  baseUrl: '/docs',
  documents: async () =>
    (await getPosts()).map((post) => ({
      id: post.slug,
      url: `/blog/${post.slug}`,
      title: post.title,
      content: post.markdown,
    })),
};
```

| Field                      | What it does                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `embeddingModel`           | An AI SDK embedding model, or `null` for keyword-only.                              |
| `embeddingProviderOptions` | Passed to the embedding model, such as `{ openai: { dimensions: 512 } }`.           |
| `chunking`                 | `{ maxChars, overlap }`.                                                            |
| `baseUrl`                  | URL prefix for pages loaded from the folder.                                        |
| `ignore`                   | Glob patterns of files to skip.                                                     |
| `framework`                | `'auto'` (the CLI's default), `'docusaurus'`, `'starlight'`, `'next'` or `'none'`.  |
| `cleanUrls`                | Drop `.html` from HTML files' URLs.                                                 |
| `documents`                | `{ id, url, title, content }` records from elsewhere, or a function returning them. |

`defineConfig` from `ask-my-site/node` types the object without a JSDoc comment. Share the config with your route handler, as the ask-my-site website does, so the index and the queries always use the same embedding model.
