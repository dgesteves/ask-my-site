The package has one CLI and these imports. Each is tree-shakeable, and only `ondocs/node`, the framework plugins and the CLI touch Node.js built-ins, so the rest runs on edge runtimes, in workers and in browsers.

| Import                          | For                                                                                                             |

The handlers are documented in [The ask endpoint](/reference/ask-endpoint/) and [MCP server](/integrations/mcp/), and the React components in [The ask dialog](/reference/ask-dialog/).

## Build and search an index yourself

The plugins and the CLI are built on these functions, which work on content from anywhere:

```ts
import { buildIndex, fromMarkdown, loadIndex, retrieve, serializeIndexFile } from 'ondocs';

const doc = fromMarkdown(source, { id: 'guide.md', url: '/guide' });
const { index, stats } = await buildIndex({ documents: [doc], embeddingModel, previous });
const loaded = loadIndex(serializeIndexFile(index));
const { hits, answerable, best } = retrieve(loaded, { text: question, vector });
```

`buildIndex` takes the previous index as `previous`, to reuse the vectors of chunks whose text is unchanged. `retrieve` returns the hits that passed the [relevance gate](/guides/retrieval/), whether any did, and the best raw signals, for tuning the gate's thresholds.

## Also exported

- **Loaders:** `fromHtml` (`root` picks the part of a page to read, as a selector such as `[data-pagefind-body]`, `ignore` what to leave out, and `markdown` keeps links and tables for a Markdown copy), `fromMarkdown` (`mdx`, `markdown`) and `fromDocuments`.
- **The index file:** `chunkDocument`, `checkIndex`, `parseIndexFile`, `validateIndexFile` and `serializeIndexFile`.
- **Text:** `tokenize`, and `createSlugger`, to use in your renderer so citations' anchors always match your headings.
- **Search's building blocks:** `Bm25Index`, `VectorIndex`, `reciprocalRankFusion`, `quantizeInt8`, `encodeVector` and `decodeVector`.
- **For agents:** `buildLlmsFiles` and `markdownPath`, which build `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` and the pages' `.md` copies from any list of pages, and `mcpInstallLinks`, the install links and commands for an MCP server's URL.
