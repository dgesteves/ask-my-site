`AskDialog` from `ondocs/react` is a command palette built on Radix Dialog and cmdk. The Docusaurus, Astro and Starlight plugins and the script tag render the same component, so everything here applies to them too, through their `dialog` options or `data-*` attributes.

## AskDialog props

| Prop                                  | Default                         | Notes                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `locale`                              | none                            | The page's locale, sent with each question, for an endpoint with an index per locale.                       |
| `followUps`                           | `true`                          | Send the thread with each question, so the endpoint can answer follow-ups; `false` asks each alone.         |

## Opening the dialog

In React, the dialog opens with ⌘K on macOS and Ctrl+K elsewhere. The plugins and the script tag use ⌘I or Ctrl+I instead, so ⌘K stays with the site's search. The shortcut does nothing while a text field or editor has focus.

To change the keyboard shortcut, pass another key, as in `shortcut="j"`, or turn it off with `shortcut={false}` and open the dialog from a `trigger` element or the `launcher` button instead. In the plugins, the same option is `dialog: { shortcut: 'j' }`, and with the script tag it is `data-shortcut="j"`.

## When the dialog's code loads

A page carries only the dialog's shortcut and, with `launcher` or `trigger`, its button. The dialog itself, Radix Dialog, cmdk and the answer, is a separate chunk that your bundler splits off, and it loads the first time the dialog is wanted: a pointer over or focus on its button or trigger, the shortcut, or `open`. A shortcut pressed while it loads is kept, so the dialog opens, with focus in its input, once it arrives; Escape before then cancels it. Focus goes back to where it was when the dialog closes, or to the button that opened it. Call `loadAskDialog()` from `ondocs/react` to load it sooner, such as when the page is idle.

In the plugins' sites this takes the JavaScript ondocs adds to each page from about 22 KB to about 3 KB with Docusaurus, and from about 88 KB to under 2 KB with Starlight, which has no React of its own; see [Benchmarks](/reference/benchmarks/#bundle-size).

## The launcher button

`launcher` adds a floating "Ask AI" button in the corner of the page, with the shortcut on it. Pass a string to change its label, as in `launcher="Ask the docs"`, and import `ondocs/embed/launcher.css` for its look, or style `.ondocs-launcher` yourself.

## Citations and navigation

Citations in the answer and the entries in the sources list link to the exact section they came from. Pass `onNavigate` to route with your framework's client router, for example `router.push(url)` in Next.js. The dialog closes after a click either way.

## Follow-up questions

The dialog keeps the thread. Once an answer is on screen, typing another question offers "Follow up", and the answer stays in view while you type. The new question goes to the endpoint with the last three questions and their answers, so it can lean on them, as in "and on Netlify?": the endpoint rewrites it into one that stands on its own before it searches (see [Follow-up questions](/reference/ask-endpoint/#follow-up-questions)). Earlier questions and answers stay above the current one, each with its own citations, which open its own sources. "New question" starts a new thread, with an empty input. `followUps={false}` asks every question on its own.

## Rating answers

When the endpoint takes feedback (its `onFeedback`), the dialog asks "Was this helpful?" under each answer, with thumbs up and down. After a rating it thanks the reader and offers "Add a comment", a one-line field that Enter sends. Both go to the endpoint, with the answer's id, and nowhere else. `useAsk` has the same as `rate(rating, comment?)`, with `feedbackEnabled` and `rating` in its state. See [Measure and improve answers](/guides/quality/#feedback-from-readers).

## Labels and languages

Every string the dialog and its button show or announce, visible or for screen readers, is a label: pass any of them as `labels`, and the rest stay in English. A `{name}` in a label is filled in: `{count}` and `{n}` with numbers, `{title}` with a page's title, `{status}` with an HTTP status. `title`, `placeholder` and `launcher` win over their labels.

```tsx
<AskDialog
  launcher
  locale="fr"
  labels={{
    launcher: 'Demander',
    placeholder: 'Posez une question…',
    newQuestion: 'Nouvelle question',
  }}
/>
```

The endpoint's own words, its "I don't know" answer, its rate limit and budget messages, its other errors and the message for an answer the model failed to write, show as it sends them, so set them there (`noAnswerMessage`, `budget.message`), or replace them in the dialog with `noAnswer`, `rateLimited`, `budgetExceeded`, `serverError` and `answerFailed`. The plugins take labels per locale; see [Docusaurus](/integrations/docusaurus/#locales-and-versions) and [Astro and Starlight](/integrations/astro/#locales-in-starlight).

## Theming the dialog

Import `ondocs/react/styles.css` for the default theme, which follows the system's light or dark setting. To change the dialog's colors, set its CSS custom properties: every color, radius and font is one, so `.ask-dialog { --ask-accent: #7c3aed; --ask-radius: 8px; }` is a complete rebrand. To style it from scratch, skip the stylesheet: every part has a stable `ask-*` class, and `classNames` adds your own, which suits Tailwind.

## Accessibility

Focus moves into the dialog when it opens and returns to where it was when it closes. The answer region is `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-busy` while text streams, and a separate status region announces when the answer is ready. All animation is turned off under `prefers-reduced-motion`. The test suite runs axe on the dialog before and after it answers, and checks that every text color in the light and dark themes keeps a contrast of at least 4.5:1.

## While an answer streams

Sources arrive before the first word, and the answer renders as it streams, batched to one update per animation frame. Closing the dialog, by Escape, a click outside or its parent, stops the answer in flight, so the model is not left generating for nobody. When an answer stops at the model's output limit, the dialog says it may be incomplete.

## The useAsk hook

`useAsk({ endpoint })` is the hook behind the dialog, for building your own interface. It returns `ask`, `stop` and `reset`, plus `status` (`idle`, `loading`, `streaming`, `done` or `error`), `question`, `answer`, `sources`, `refused`, `truncated`, `retrieval`, `error` and `turns`, the thread's earlier questions with their answers and sources. `ask` adds the answer on screen to `turns` and sends the thread with the next question, and `reset` starts a new thread; `followUps: false` keeps no thread. `error.kind` is `rate-limited`, `http`, `network` or `stream`, with `retryAfter` for rate limits. `stop()` keeps the partial answer.

`AskAnswer` renders an answer with clickable citations from `answer` and `sources`. It renders a small Markdown subset, never HTML, and only turns `[n]` into a link when source `n` exists.
