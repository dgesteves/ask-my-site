Agents read docs as Markdown. With the same pages it indexes, ask-my-site writes three files that agents look for:

- **`llms.txt`**, as [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) describes it: the site's name, its summary, and a section of links per part of the site, each to the page's Markdown copy. It also names the [MCP server](/integrations/mcp/) when there is one.
- **`llms-full.txt`**: every page in one file, for a model to read in one request.
- **A Markdown copy of each page**, at its URL plus `.md`: `/docs/intro.md` for `/docs/intro` or `/docs/intro/`, and `/index.md` for the site's root. That is where Mintlify, GitBook, Fumadocs and the Docusaurus and Starlight llms plugins put them. Each starts with a line pointing to `llms.txt`.

The pages are the ones in the index, so `exclude` leaves a page out of both. Built from the HTML the site serves, a copy keeps the page's links, emphasis, code blocks with their language, numbered and nested lists, tables and quotes. The index itself is unchanged: it holds the text it always did.

This site serves its own: [/llms.txt](https://ask-my-site-demo.vercel.app/llms.txt), [/llms-full.txt](https://ask-my-site-demo.vercel.app/llms-full.txt), and every page plus `.md`, as [/docs/mcp.md](https://ask-my-site-demo.vercel.app/docs/mcp.md).

## In Docusaurus, Astro and Starlight

The plugins write all three after the build, into the build output next to `ask-index.json`, with nothing to set: `build/` for Docusaurus and `dist/` for Astro (`dist/client/` with an adapter). Each locale gets its own, as the index does. `llms.txt` takes its title and summary from the site's title and its tagline (Docusaurus) or description (Starlight), and links absolutely when the site has a URL: `url` in Docusaurus, `site` in Astro.

Turn them off with `llmsTxt: false`, or one at a time:

```ts
plugins: [['ask-my-site/docusaurus', { llmsTxt: { full: false, markdown: false } }]],
```

`llmsTxt` takes `index`, `full` and `markdown` (each on by default), and `title` and `description` to name the site.

## Alongside other llms plugins

A site that already uses an llms plugin keeps it. The plugins never replace a file the build already has, from `static/` or `public/` or another plugin, and say so. They also leave out what a known plugin writes, by its name and options:

| Plugin                                                          | Leaves to it                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docusaurus-plugin-llms`                                        | `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and the `.md` copies with `generateMarkdownFiles` |
| `@signalwire/docusaurus-plugin-llms-txt` (and the unscoped one) | `llms.txt`, the `.md` copies unless turned off, and `llms-full.txt` when on    |
| `docusaurus-plugin-copy-page-button`                            | the `.md` copies, with `generateMarkdownRoutes`                                |
| `starlight-llms-txt`                                            | `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`                                                 |
| `starlight-page-actions`, `starlight-llm-actions`               | the `.md` copies                                                               |

## With the CLI

`--llms-txt <dir>` writes the three files into `dir`, the folder your site serves at its root, such as `public/` in Next.js. A page's copy goes at its URL there: `/docs/intro` is `public/docs/intro.md`. Unlike the plugins, the CLI replaces what is there, since you named the folder.

```sh
npx ask-my-site index content/docs --base-url /docs --llms-txt public \
  --llms-title "Acme Docs" --llms-description "Docs for Acme." \
  --site-url https://docs.acme.dev --mcp-url https://docs.acme.dev/api/mcp
```

`--no-llms-index`, `--no-llms-full` and `--no-llms-markdown` leave one out, and a config module can set the same under `llmsTxt`. From Markdown sources, a copy keeps the Markdown as written, links and images included, without MDX imports and components. This site runs it with `--no-llms-index`, because it curates its own `llms.txt` in its sidebar's order.

## Serving them

Static hosts serve `.md` files as they are; check that yours sends them as `text/markdown` or `text/plain` rather than as a download. A site whose pages each have a Markdown copy can also tell agents with a `Link` header or `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" href="/docs/intro.md">`, which the plugins do not add.
